# StepOne: Strategy & Monetization Proposal

## 1. The Problem
For the **@packslight** community—multi-passionate women travelers and entrepreneurs—the barrier to a "dream life" isn't a lack of vision; it's the friction of daily consistency. Generic habit trackers fail because they don't bridge the gap between small domestic tasks (Step 1) and high-stakes travel/business goals (Step 2). There is a psychological "canyon" between making your bed and booking a solo flight to a foreign country.

## 2. Target Audience: The CEO-Explorer
StepOne targets Gen-Z and Millennial women who:
* **Value "Delusional Confidence"** as a tool for growth.
* **Are building digital nomad businesses** or aspiring to solo travel.
* **Need a low-friction way** to train their "focus muscle" in unpredictable environments.

## 3. The Solution: "Adventure Training"
StepOne gamifies focus through a tactile **Passport Book** interface.
* **Tactile Progress:** Users earn digital stamps for completing 2, 4, or 6-minute "Deep Work" sessions.
* **Focus Accountability:** The "Stay-on-App" timer resets if the user leaves the app, training the mental grit needed to work in busy transit hubs or foreign cafes.
* **Personalized Ambition:** A branching onboarding flow allows users to tailor their experience to Business, Travel, Health, or Hobbies.

## 4. Monetization Strategy (Powered by RevenueCat)
We implement a **Hybrid Monetization Model** to capture both high-intent long-term users and subscription-ready explorers:

### Free Tier
* Access to the "Daily Foundation" micro-actions.
* First 7 days of the "Journey Path" (The 30-day adventure roadmap).
* Standard circular focus timer.

### Pro Explorer (Premium Tier)
* **Monthly Subscription ($4.99/mo):** Unlocks the full 30-day Journey Path and the **Personalized Focus Switcher**.
* **Lifetime Legend ($29.99 One-Time):** All Pro features unlocked forever, including future "Social Missions".

### 14-Day Pro Trial Logic
We purposefully selected a **14-day free trial** rather than the standard 7-day industry norm. Based on my personal journey of building a walking habit, I found that the first 7 days are the easiest to ignore or quit. It is during the **second week (Days 8–14)** that a micro-action shifts from an "easy-to-ignore chore" into an **"actively pursued thought."** By providing 14 days, we give users enough time to move past the initial resistance and actually feel the psychological benefit of the app before they commit to a subscription.

### Conversion Strategy
After the first stamp is earned, guests are prompted to create an account to sync progress, creating a natural hook for the Pro trial before they hit the Day 7 Journey lock.

## 5. Technical Innovation
* **RevenueCat SDK:** Handles complex entitlement logic for switching ambitions and locking sequential missions.
* **Sign in with Apple:** Ensures a secure, high-quality, and frictionless onboarding experience.
* **Tactile UX:** SVG-based Lucide icons and a paper-textured Passport interface provide a premium, "non-app" feel.
